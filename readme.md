About the project:
-------------------------------------------------
1. As you may know, blockchain is a way of storing digital data. 
2. In BITSCoin, it’s the transactions (logs of transfers of BITSCoins from one account to another). 
3. The data  here is stored in the form of blocks, which are chained together using cryptographic hashes. 
4. Students at the start of each semester, get ₹12,000 worth of BITSCoins that they get to spend on outlets, merchandise and workshops. 
5. We can integrate this with the existing smart campus application to make the system more robust and dependable.
